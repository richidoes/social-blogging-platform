## Getting Started

First, clone repo.

Then, I personally recommend that you modify the file "firebase.ts" in the directory: "lib / firebase.ts" and replacing all the data in the variable "firebaseConfig" with your own firebase configuration.

Once you've done that, install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

Finally, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Now You can start editing the project.
